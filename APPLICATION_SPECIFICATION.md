### Notification Content Structure

#### Email Template Structure
```html
Subject: [INTUNE] Device Enrollment {STATUS} - {DEVICE_NAME}

Body:
- Event Summary
- Device Information
- User Information
- Timestamp
- Error Details (if failure)
- Diagnostic Information
- Recommended Actions
```

#### Diagnostic Information Included

- **Network Information**: IP address, location (if available)
- **Error Codes**: Specific Intune error codes and descriptions
- **Policy Status**: Applied/failed policies and configurations
- **Troubleshooting Steps**: Automated recommendations based on error type

### Security Considerations

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **Azure AD App Registration**: Service principal for Graph API access
- **Managed Identity**: For Azure service authentication
- **RBAC**: Least privilege access principles
- **API Permissions**: Minimum required Graph API permissions
